# Rate My Pasta

*Why?*

I once bought an overpriced pasta, which I then tried to cook based on the instructions - that failed, and I had to continue to cook it for 4x longer than indicated. The pasta still had a horrible taste. 

So I thought, how would other people find out about this?

There is no way to rate pasta that is sold in the supermarket. There are no testimonials, or they're scattered/imbalanced when you shop online. What if there was a place where you go for your pasta choices? It's ridiculous, of course, but also so niche that it might be helpful.

And I definitely felt vindictive after that horrific past experience.

*A word on my skills*

I know SQL and some Python, and as much HTML/CSS that a person in 2017 manages to learn from using the Internet, but I am in NO WAY a web developer, a front-end master or a full-stack God. This project comes from my frustration with normal learning experiences, in which you do tutorials that don't teach you jack, or trudge through compartmentalised lessons that don't add up to the full puzzle. 

So I'll just wing it; learn by doing. 

It means I'll have to discover things long discovered, anew. If I don't keep developing my skills after I plateau, I will be one of those horrible developers who bless the world with spaghetti code because they don't know what they're doing, and they're too lazy to learn new stuff or to refactor code.
